# Contributing to Bonança

I welcome contributions from the community to help improve Bonança! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions are valuable to me. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the Bonança repository on GitHub to create your own copy of the project.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-new-bot` or `bugfix/fix-index-calculation`.
3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch. Ensure that your code follows the existing coding style and conventions used in the project.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Write tests for your changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new issues. Run existing tests to verify that everything is still functioning correctly.
5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the changes.
6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
7. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your branch to the main Bonança repository. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made and any relevant information for reviewers.
