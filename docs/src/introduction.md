# Bonança CLI

Bonança (pronounced boh-nahn-sah) is a Portuguese word used to describe a period of prosperity and tranquility, that typically comes after a period of instability or hardship. In the context of this project, Bonança represents a tool that aims to bring financial stability and growth to cryptocurrency investors.

A big insipration for the name comes from a verse in a famous Brazilian funk song "Rap da Felicidade" by Cidinho and Doca:

> "Sofri na tempestade, agora eu quero a bonança">

Which translates to "I suffered in the storm, now I want prosperity". I hope this CLI can help users find their own "bonança" in the volatile world of cryptocurrency investing.
